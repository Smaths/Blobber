  AssetIdentifier: Heureka.AssetHunterPRO
  Description: 'Asset Hunter PRO is THE project cleaning tool of the asset store.
    It will help you locate all the unused asset and delete them. It will reduce
    time spend waiting for the editor to load. It also simply boosts productivity
    in general by having to search through less stuff.


    Its based on the learnings
    from Asset Hunter 2, but its a full rewrite with new features, new UI, improved
    workflow and HUGE performance gains.


    Asset Hunter can also aid you in finding
    those pesky assets that bloat your buildsize by giving you a sortable list of
    used assets.


    Also includes a reference graph and a way to find duplicate
    assets'
