  Description: 'SmartBuilder will speed up your level production


    100% plug
    and play, no setup required!


    Smartbuilder gives you a intutitive window
    with a list of context sensitive assets - i.e. if you are building a forest,
    it gives you a grid of vegetation prefabs and if you are building a Village it
    gives you a grid of houses. It will reflect your selection, and always show you
    the most relevant prefabs and allow you to drag directly into the scene. It does
    this by analyzing the filename, directory, tags and labels of your assets.
