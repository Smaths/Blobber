  Description: 'Asset Hunter is THE project cleaning tool of the asset store.


    It
    helps you locate all the unused asset and delete them. It will reduce time spend
    waiting for the editor to load, it also simply boosts productivity in general
    by having to search through less stuff.


    Quick start:

    1: Open Asset
    Hunter PRO (Ctrl+H)

    2: Create a build

    3: Load newly created log into
    Asset Hunter PRO

    4: Inspect and delete unused assets

    5: Use settings
    to ignore certain types, folders etc.


    Quick Start (Asset dependency graph)

    1:
    Open Dependency Graph (Ctrl+Shift+H)

    2: Press "Build Cache" button

    3:
    Select an asset in project window


    On the roadmap:

    Improved unused
    script detection

    Buildinfo comparison
